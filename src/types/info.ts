  bio:
    `
    I am a React Developer at Sulovi Technologies Private Limited, where I create robust and innovative web applications using a wide array of technologies. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science Engineering from BSACET, Mathura.
    At Sulovi, I spearheaded the development and maintenance of applications using React and Firebase, introducing features such as virtualization, WhatsApp cloud API integration, and no-internet functionality. I also implemented a Google Cloud function as a microservice for backend tasks using Python, and migrated the Redux legacy pipeline to Redux Toolkit. I collaborated with other developers, tested the code quality, and documented the features and functionalities. I am always eager to learn new skills, enhance my existing ones, and deliver efficient solutions.
